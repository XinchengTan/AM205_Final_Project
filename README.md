# AM205 Final Project
##### Contributors: Xincheng Tan, Yaxin Lei
Topic: Gaussian graphical model (GGM) and randomized linear algebra (RLA) for estimating the functional connectivity 
among a neuron population

## Dataset
The datasets we use for this project is published by Carsen Stringer at 
https://janelia.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Recordings_of_10k_neurons_in_V1_during_drifting_gratings/6214019.  
In order to run the jupyter notebook code, please download the whole dataset locally and specify the correct path.


## Code
The main code for functional connectivity estimation is in the .ipynb file. 
The rest of the .py files provide helper functions to load the dataset,
apply the Gaussian graphical model with and without RLA, and plot the estimated results under various measures.
